# Lung-segmentation-by-image-processing
Lung segmentation on Chest-Xray dataset by traditional image processing method
Five steps for out algorithm
1.Canny edge detection and otsu for segmentation and background removal
2.close operation to remove edge disconnect
3.extract lung parts by setting up connect regions' size
4.remove empty small holes in lung parts
5.calculate image coefficience
